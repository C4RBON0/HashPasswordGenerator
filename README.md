# HashPasswordGenerator
Introducing a password enables us to chose between diferent hash functions to encrypt our password, this is how computers save our passwords (/etc/shadow in linux)) done with google colab.
It also has the function to crack MD5 hash passwords, by default the size is 5, but it can be changed.

This has been made for educational purposes, in order to understand how hashing work.

In the future I would like to change it from google colab file to python, I'll do it when I finish some to does.
